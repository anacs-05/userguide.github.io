            <h2>Introdution to GitHub</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <p>GitHub is a cloud-based platform designed for storing, sharing, and collaborating on code with others. It hosts Git repositories and offers developers tools to enhance code quality, including command-line functions, issue tracking (for threaded discussions), pull requests, and code reviews.
                   <br>The benefits of keeping your code in a GitHub "repository" include:
                    </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Displaying or sharing your work with others.</li>
                    <li>Tracking and managing changes to your code over time.</li>
                    <li>Allowing others to review your code and provide suggestions for improvement.</li>
                    <li>Collaborating on a shared project without affecting your teammates work until you’re ready to merge your changes.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>GIT</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <p>Collaborative work is one of GitHub’s core features, made possible by the open-source software Git. Git is a version control system that efficiently tracks changes to files, forming the foundation on which GitHub is built. It’s especially valuable when multiple people are working on the same files simultaneously.
                <br>Here are some key functions Git enables:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a branch from the main version of the files that you and your collaborators are working on.</li>
                    <li>Edit files independently and safely within your own branch.</li>
                    <li>Allow Git to intelligently merge your specific changes back into the main version, preventing interference with others' updates.
                    </li>
                    <li>Track changes made by you and others, ensuring everyone works with the latest version of the project.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>A version control system (VCS) logs the history of changes as individuals and teams collaborate on projects, allowing you to see what was changed, by whom, and when. In a distributed version control system, each developer maintains a complete copy of the project and its history.

                </div>
                <p><br>Git and GitHub together form a powerful combination for software development. While they serve different purposes, they complement each other perfectly to support efficient project collaboration and version management.</p>
                <p>When you upload files to GitHub, they’re stored in a “Git repository.” This means that as you make changes (or “commits”) to your files, Git automatically begins tracking and managing each modification.</p>
                <p> The typical workflow with Git and GitHub involves working on your files locally (on your own computer) and then regularly syncing these changes — along with all related Git history — to a “remote” repository on GitHub. </p>
